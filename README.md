# MoveSmith [TO-BE-UPDATED]

A Move source code level fuzzer.

# Usage

Make sure you have all the necessary [dependencies](#dependencies).

## Fuzzing

To start a basic fuzzing session, run
```bash
cargo fuzz run <fuzz_target>
```

To run more advanced session that runs 10 workers in parallel, use the `fuzz.sh` script:
```bash
./scripts/fuzz.sh <fuzz_target> [total_hour] [max_input_len] [timeout]
# If `max_input_len` is 0, initial random corpus will be generated.

# For example
./scripts/fuzz.sh transactional 24 4 3
# This will run the `transactional` target for 24 hours with randomly created
# seeds whose size doesn't exceed 4KB.
# For each input, it will timeout after 3 seconds.


# If a fuzz target starts with `afl++`, the script will spawn nodes in a tmux session:
./scripts/fuzz.sh afl-transactional 24 4
# This will create a tmux session `afl_fuzzing` where each node occupies a window.
```

The script will keep a copy of log under `logs`.
Note that the script will automatically spawn tmux sessions for running AFL++
fuzzing sessions so be careful using AFL inside a tmux session.

### Fuzz Targets

All fuzz targets live in `fuzz/fuzz_targets`:

* `compile_only`: compiles the generated Move programs using both compiler V1 and V2 and compare if they both success or fail
* `transactional`: run the generated Move programs as transactional tests so that we can cover compiler V1, V2, and the VM
* `afl-transactional`: the same as transactional but uses AFL++ instead of libfuzzer

For libFuzzer, crashing inputs are stored in `fuzz/artifacts/<fuzz_target>`.
For AFL++, they are stored in `fuzz/afl/<fuzz_target>_out/fuzzer#/crashes`.

## CLI Helpers

`raw2move` converts bytes from STDIN to a Move program the same as how the fuzzer
uses raw input. The resulting Move code will be printed to STDOUT.
```bash
cargo run --bin raw2move < fuzz/artifacts/<fuzz_target>/<input_file>
```

---

`generator` can statically generate a number of Move files/packages with a fixed seed.
This could be helpful to debug the fuzzer or to use the generated files for other purposes.

The generator can be used by `cargo run --bin generator -- <Options>` and available options are:
```
Options:
  -o, --output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>  The output directory to store the generated Move files
  -s, --seed <SEED>              An optional number as seed, the default should be 0 [default: 0]
  -n, --num-files <NUM_FILES>    An optional number as the number of files to generate, the default should be 100 [default: 100]
  -p, --package                  A boolean flag to create a package, default to false
```

---

`run_transactional` takes input the path to a Move file and runs it as transactional test.
```bash
cargo run --bin run_transactional path/to/file.move
```

---

`check_artifact` essentially is the combination of `raw2move` and `run_transactional`:
it reads a file that contains raw bytes, converts it to Move, compiles and runs it as
transactional test.

```bash
cargo run --bin check_artifact -- -f path/to/raw/input
```


## Coverage

After running a fuzzing session, the coverage of all stored corpus can be generated by:
```bash
./scripts/coverage.sh <fuzz_target> [base_dir]
```

If the fuzzing session was run on the local machine, you can ignore `base_dir`.

If you want to generate the coverage from a different corpus (e.g. generated from another machine),
use the `base_dir` to specify the directory that contains `fuzz/` where `corpus` is stored for libFuzzer,
or `afl` is stored for AFL++.

This will create an HTML report at `[base_dir/]coverage/<fuzz_target>/index.html`.

### Coverage over time

For libFuzzer results, you can use the `scipts/coverage_graph.py` to draw a coverage over time graph:
```bash
python scripts/coverage_graph.py path/to/log
```

For AFL++ results, you can use
```bash
cargo afl plot fuzz/afl/<fuzz_target>_out/fuzzer0 <ouput_dir>
```
to plot several key statistics.
They can be viewed at `<output_dir>/index.html`.

## Debugging

### Compilation

The script `./scripts/check_output.sh` is a helper for checking the generated programs.
By default it generates 10 Move packages stored in `output/`, compiles with both compilers, run transactional tests,
and reports any error encountered.

Use `./scripts/check_output.sh N` to generate `N` packages instead.

### Transactional test

To execute the generated Move programs as transactional tests, use the script:
```
./scripts/transactional-test.sh N
```

This script will generate `N` programs under `third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/transactional-tests/tests/move-smith`.
It will than apply a patch to the test harness to only run with the newly generated files.

# Dependencies

## cargo-fuzz

[cargo-fuzz][cargo-fuzz] provides many handy commands for running fuzzing. Install with:
```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

## [Optional] cargo-afl
To run AFL++ targets, you need to install [cargo-afl][cargo-afl]:
```bash
cargo install cargo-afl
```

To plot AFL++ statistics, you might need to install `gnuplot`:
```bash
brew install gnuplot
```

## Nightly Toolchain

The nightly rust toolchain is required for instrumenting the code. Install with:
```bash
rustup install nightly
```

To overwrite the top-level `rust-toolchain.toml`, use:
```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

## [Optional] Coverage

To generate human-readable coverage reports, we need `llvm` coverage tools.
They can be installed with:
```bash
cargo install cargo-binutils
rustup component add --toolchain nightly llvm-tools-preview
```
